Book my show planning

1. We need a reusable carousel 
    -> Hero carousel
    -> common carousel
    -> cast and crew small carousel

2. Pages
    -> Home Page
    -> Movie Page
    -> Categories Page
    -> Authentication Page
    -> Razorpay payment gateway

3. Plan (How are we building it)
    -> Layouts
    -> Routes
    -> Pages
    -> Components


Notes:
Layouts -> 
Components -> Independent and reusable bits of code
    Takes props and state and returns JSX code
HOC (Higher Order Components) -> Component which returns a component (class/function components)

Layout-first Approach -> 
You make the skeleton/layout of the app and update only the contents inside the layout
i.e. layout remains as a default or static element of the app which doesn't change after being rendered once
How to make changes in layout ->
    -> Using props (if you've limited changes)
    -> Making different layout and components for different pages (if you've lots of changes)
